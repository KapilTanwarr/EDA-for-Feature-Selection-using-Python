# EDA for Feature Selection using Python

this project performs an in-depth analysis of a dynamic pricing dataset. The goal is to explore and understand the data using both univariate and bivariate analysis techniques, with a focus on the key factors influencing the historical cost of rides.

# Project Overview
The dataset used in this project includes features related to rides, drivers, customers, and other variables that affect dynamic pricing models. The analysis covers the following key areas:

Univariate Analysis: Understanding the distribution of individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between features and the Historical_Cost_of_Ride.


# Requirements
To run this analysis, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

# Analysis Steps
Data Loading and Inspection:

Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
Check for missing values and data types.
Univariate Analysis:

Explore the distribution of numerical features using histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots.
Investigate the distribution of categorical features using count plots.
Bivariate Analysis:

For numerical features, explore the relationships between each feature and the Historical_Cost_of_Ride using scatter plots.
For categorical features, investigate the influence of each feature on Historical_Cost_of_Ride using box plots.


# Key Functions and Libraries
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: Used for creating visualizations to explore distributions and relationships within the data.

# Visualizations
Univariate Analysis: Histograms and count plots help visualize the distribution of individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots and box plots reveal correlations between the Historical_Cost_of_Ride and other features.


# Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into how various features, such as the number of riders, vehicle type, and customer loyalty status, influence ride costs in a dynamic pricing model. By understanding these relationships, we can gain deeper insights into the pricing structure and its influencing factors.
